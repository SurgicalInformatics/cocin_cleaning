These further cleaning scripts should be applied on objects created with the main cleaning scripts from https://github.com/SurgicalInformatics/cocin_ccp

ccp_data includes all variables and data points that in oneline and more (oneline is a subset of ccp_data). If something has been cleaned in oneline, it's not necessarily cleaned in ccp_data too. So either apply cleaning in both, or always prioritise oneline, joining in further necessary columns from ccp_data.
